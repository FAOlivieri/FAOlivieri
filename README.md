I'm a protein scientist with a PhD in Biochemistry and M.Sc in Molecular Biology. Most of my work revolves around characterizing protein processes through bioinformatics and computational biology. I'm very interested in data science and its application to biology.

PostDoc at the Slovenian National Institute of Chemistry, Designed Dynamic Proteins laboratory
